# Cas' Home Assistant config
https://home-assistant.io


## What's this?
Honestly, it's just a backup to make sure I don't lose all my home automation stuff

## What can I use it for?
Ideas on fun home automation projects I guess? idk it's just a backup.

## What's in here?

* Some utility meters for keeping track of energy and gas usage
* A few automations that turn on/off the lights depending on whether the sun is up and whether someone's home
* An automation that turns on Sonos when we first go downstairs in the morning
* A Lovelace view that perfectly fits on my phone screen to turn on the lights & music
* Some scripts that I've written because HA doesn't have easily toggleable entities

## Where do I start?

`configuration.yaml` probably. 

## I still have questions
email me at homeassistant [at] cascer1 [dot] space, I guess. Though if it's related to HA I probably won't be able to help.
